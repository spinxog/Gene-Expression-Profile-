# Live Camera Identification

Currently in the process of training. 

I'm using the cifar-10 dataset for images since I don't have the necessary resources to gather and process larger image datasets.
Using a custom convluted network, since that proves to be decent currently, i have currently trained to 23/200 epochs and I have getting 88.9% overall and using training im  seeing upwards of 96.4%. I will continute and look for futher improvement.
